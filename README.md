# Goal-Driven Deep RL Policy for Robot Navigation
Deep Reinforcement Learning for mobile robot navigation in ROS2 Gazebo simulator. Using Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) neural network, a robot learns to navigate to a random goal point in a simulated environment while avoiding obstacles. Trained in ROS2 Humble & Gazebo simulator with PyTorch.
